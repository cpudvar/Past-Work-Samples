Programmer: Caleb Pudvar

Description: This program executes text mining and results from analysis of the Federalist Papers. From an XML document, the text is broken out into directories where it is properly analyzed. Within this folder are my results, sample charts, and my report on my findings.

INPUT: Federalist papers in same directory as script (as XML)

OUTPUT: Three .csv files to be used for either cluster analysis (matplotlib) or CART:
		Preprocessed_Text.csv (matplotlib)
		Raw_Text.csv (matplotlib)
		Preprocessed_CART (CART)

NOTE: Must have numpy, scipy, matplotlib in order to run 2_clusterFed.py 
      Change file name within 2_clusterFed.py to analyze different .csv's
	(for cluster analysis)
