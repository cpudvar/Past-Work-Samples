Description: Included is two copies of an 8-puzzle solver coded using python v3.1.2. Both are constructed to solve using Best-First Search. The available heuristics are (number of misplaced tiles) and (Manhattan Distance). It is initially configured to compute 100 random boards, but the number can easily be changed in the src.

Input: NONE

Output(stdout, console): 

	HEURISTIC: (heuristic name)

	Average Number of moves:  X.XX
	Average Max Queue Size:   X.XX

	Total runtime:  X seconds.
	Average runtime: X seconds.

     In the folder containing this program, two folders are present. They are "Manhattan Version" and "Misplaced Version". Within these folders are the appropriate source code sets. Additionally, there are two sample output files that can be generated by uncommenting code in the "Best-First Search" method within the main src file, changing the iteration from 100 to 1, and and overriding the random board with one of the pre-defined boards in the appropriate Board class. Lastly, my report on the analysis of these two programs is included as a .pdf 

There are currently no known bugs within this code.
